At EmpowHER, our mission is to create a user-friendly interactive website that emphasizes the lack of women and non-binary people in executive positions through clear and concise data visualizations. This was done by presenting the graphic representation of gender disparity in Fortune 500 companies, as well as providing a solution to this problem by creating a directory of women-owned businesses.

This website was conceptualized and developed during a Kode with Klossy virtual camp. Through this opportunity, three young women have made a fully functional website and data solution dedicated to supporting underrepresented leaders in a heavily male-dominated field.
