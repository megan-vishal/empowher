        <h1 class="statement-text"> 
          Although women hold a majority of the buying power, their spending often supports companies with underrepresentation in their boardrooms. According to Forbesâ€™ annual statistics, women drive 70-80% of all consumer purchasing decisions and globally, women account for $20 trillion in annual consumer spending. Despite their large buying power and influence, only 10% of executive positions are held by women. The severe lack of gender-diversity in executive boardrooms results in a major loss of valuable insight in addition to loss in profits.
